# Milkv_duo_Ubuntu_image
This is an Ubuntu 22.04 image for milkv duo boards (256M and 512M)

This is an image for Ubuntu 22.04 for milk-v boards (risk-v). The starting point was the image found here: https://xyzdims.com/3d-printers/misc-hardware-notes/iot-milk-v-duo-risc-v-esbc-running-linux/
The image used seems to work on both the Milk-v duo 256m and on the Milk-v Duo S (512m). I used the Milk-v Duo S as the working platform because the processor has more memory available.

Using ordinary tools I installed the gcc compiler and other build essentials without problems.
Next I downloaded the Nano editor source code and successfully compiled the program that now is available as "nano".
